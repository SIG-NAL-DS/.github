Started in 2012 as a 501 (c) 3 non-profit, SIG-NAL advances science, policy, and practice for climate-resilient urban and natural landscapes. We work with federal, state, tribal, and municipal partners to develop and implement climate-informed conservation strategies that benefit vulnerable communities and biodiversity. From wildfire resilience planning to green stormwater infrastructure, we create adaptive strategies for a changing climate.
